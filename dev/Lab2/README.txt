Question 1:
I was unable to run the tests on my Homework 2 code because I did not have (nor did anyone in my group have) a functional Homework 2 OurSet object.
The TAs mentioned to turn in the assignments anyway and run the tests later once Homework 2 is completed.

Question 2:
It's important to test every part and situation of a function. Therefore, in my add() test, I tested both adding an element that does exist and one that doesn't exist (in the original set).
I could have tested many other cases in the various other methods, such as adding a list to a set that already has all the elements in it.
